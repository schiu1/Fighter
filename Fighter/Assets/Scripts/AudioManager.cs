    //when calling to play a sound clip, it gets it from an AudioSource component of same name
    //so instead of creating AudioSource components manually, spamming the gameobject, we use this to automate it
    //this script will automatically create an AudioSource in the same gameobject for each Sound type object in the Sound[] clips array

    //the Sound class will have the fields: string name, AudioClip clip, float volume, bool loop, and AudioSource source
    //the reason AudioSource is there is to store it so that when we play it later, we can call the Play() method on the AudioSource within Sound object
    //(it also makes code look cleaner as opposed to creating another array in AudioManager that represent each AudioSource)

    //the Sound[] clips array will be populated through the inspector, so it should be public/private with SerializeField
    //in Awake(), that should be where each Sound type clip will be inserted into a new AudioSource component for each clip
    //use for each loop, and include the same fields
    //create Play() method within AudioManager too, with string name as parameter
