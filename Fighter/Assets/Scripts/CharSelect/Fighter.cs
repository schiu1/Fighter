    /*
     * this will be a template of a fighter
     * also a place to outline how to go about creating this
     * 
     * the main menu will go into Fighter_Select 
     * and show all characters that are available
     * there will be a next and previous button with
     * the fighter in idle stance in the middle
     * 
     * when the character is chosen and play button is pressed
     * the controls/behavior/combat scripts will be "filled in"
     * it will be filled in with the fields in this template
     * 
     * at first thought, it seems like majority of the difference
     * in fighters would be in: animations, 
     * floats that would sync up things with the animations of the fighter
     * like attack cooldowns and capCollider size,
     * and hitboxes in the inspector
     * 
     * so maybe this fighter script will hold access to the animations?
     * i don't know how to do that in c# so i would have to learn how to do that
     * it would also hold the values of floats that are character specific like
     * attack cooldowns and capCollider size to be inserted into controls/behavior/combat scripts
     * it would also maybe create the hurtboxes and hitboxes needed for character attacks
     * 
     * this looks intimidating
